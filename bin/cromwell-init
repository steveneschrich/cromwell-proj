# The goal of this script is to create a new cromwell project. This is 
# envisioned to be a directory containing various files needed to
# execute a cromwell workflow.


# create directory name
# create marker file (.cromwell-project-root)

# mkdir bin
# grab bin release? and extract in bin
# mkdir lib
# grab cromwell binaries and extract in lib
# grab skeleton and extract (lib, main directory)
# mkdir data-raw, data, etc per BBSR
# mkdir conf
# grab cromwell-conf project and populate
# Print out some comments about how to use

# This needs a bit more thought; kind of chicken and egg problem.
# Would want to run (for instance) cromwell-udpate, but that implies
# it's already there (and directory, and marker file). So hmmm.
